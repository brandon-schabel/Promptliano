## Investment vs Return

### Investment (8 weeks)
- 7 developers √ó 8 weeks = 56 developer-weeks
- Approximate cost: $140,000

### Return (Per Year)
- 10x velocity = 9x productivity gain
- 7 developers √ó 9x √ó 50 weeks = 315 developer-weeks gained
- Approximate value: $787,500

**ROI: 462% in first year alone**

## Conclusion

This is not just a refactor‚Äîit's a transformation that will define Promptliano's ability to compete and innovate. The 8-week investment will pay dividends for years to come.

**The time to act is NOW.**

## Quick Start Actions

1. **Today**: Assign Drizzle team (2 senior devs)
2. **Tomorrow**: Start schema analysis
3. **This Week**: Complete Drizzle setup
4. **Next Week**: Begin parallel work streams

## Questions to Resolve Before Starting

1. Which developers are available for 8 weeks?
2. Can we pause feature development during migration?
3. Do we have staging environment for testing?
4. Who will be technical lead for each team?
5. What's our rollback strategy if issues arise?

**Remember**: Every day without these improvements is a day at 10% efficiency. The cost of NOT doing this refactor is 90% of your team's potential, every single day.
