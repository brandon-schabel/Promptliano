# Architecture Improvements - Dependency Graph

## Overview
This document maps the dependencies between all architecture improvements, identifying what must be done sequentially and what can be done in parallel.

## Critical Path (Sequential - MUST be in order)

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[01: Drizzle ORM Migration - Foundation] --> B[02: Storage Layer Overhaul]
    B --> C[03: Service Layer Patterns]
    A --> D[07: Frontend Hook Factory]
    D --> E[08: Frontend Optimizations]
```

## Parallel Work Opportunities

### After Drizzle ORM is complete, these can be done in parallel:

```mermaid

    A[01: Drizzle ORM Complete] --> B[Group 1: Storage/Services]
    A --> C[Group 2: Route Generation]
    A --> D[Group 3: Error Handling]
    A --> E[Group 4: Interceptors]
    A --> F[Group 5: Frontend Hooks]
```

## Detailed Dependencies

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL - Must Be First
**01-drizzle-orm-migration.md**
- **Dependencies:** None (Foundation)
- **Blocks:** Everything else
- **Why:** Becomes the single source of truth for all schemas
- **Estimated Time:** 1-2 weeks
- **Team Size:** 1-2 developers

### ðŸŸ¡ Backend Core (Depends on Drizzle)

**02-storage-layer-overhaul.md**
- **Dependencies:** 01 (Drizzle ORM)
- **Blocks:** 03 (Service Layer)
- **Can parallel with:** 04, 05, 06, 07
- **Estimated Time:** 2-3 weeks
- **Team Size:** 2-3 developers

**03-service-layer-patterns.md**
- **Dependencies:** 01, 02 (Drizzle + Storage)
- **Blocks:** API consumption
- **Can parallel with:** 04, 05, 06
- **Estimated Time:** 2 weeks
- **Team Size:** 2 developers

### ðŸŸ¢ Parallel Backend (Can start after Drizzle)

**04-route-generation.md**
- **Dependencies:** 01 (Drizzle schemas)
- **Blocks:** None
- **Can parallel with:** 02, 05, 06, 07
- **Estimated Time:** 1 week
- **Team Size:** 1 developer

**05-error-factory.md**
- **Dependencies:** None (but better with 01)
- **Blocks:** None
- **Can parallel with:** All others
- **Estimated Time:** 3-4 days
- **Team Size:** 1 developer

**06-interceptors.md**
- **Dependencies:** None
- **Blocks:** None
- **Can parallel with:** All others
- **Estimated Time:** 3-4 days
- **Team Size:** 1 developer

### ðŸ”µ Frontend (Depends on Backend schemas)

**07-frontend-hook-factory.md**
- **Dependencies:** 01 (Drizzle schemas)
- **Blocks:** 08 (Frontend optimizations)
- **Can parallel with:** 02, 03, 04, 05, 06
- **Estimated Time:** 2-3 weeks
- **Team Size:** 2-3 developers

**08-frontend-optimizations.md**
- **Dependencies:** 07 (Hook Factory)
- **Blocks:** None
- **Can parallel with:** Late-stage backend work
- **Estimated Time:** 1-2 weeks
- **Team Size:** 2 developers

## Optimal Team Distribution

### Sprint 1-2: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- **Team A (2 devs):** 01-drizzle-orm-migration.md

### Sprint 3-4: Parallel Execution (Weeks 3-4)
- **Team A (3 devs):** 02-storage-layer-overhaul.md
- **Team B (2 devs):** 07-frontend-hook-factory.md (start)
- **Team C (1 dev):** 04-route-generation.md
- **Team D (1 dev):** 05-error-factory.md + 06-interceptors.md

### Sprint 5-6: Integration (Weeks 5-6)
- **Team A (2 devs):** 03-service-layer-patterns.md
- **Team B (3 devs):** 07-frontend-hook-factory.md (complete)
- **Team C+D (2 devs):** Integration and testing

### Sprint 7-8: Optimization (Weeks 7-8)
- **Team B (2 devs):** 08-frontend-optimizations.md
- **All teams:** Migration, testing, and refinement

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Dependencies
1. **Drizzle ORM Migration** - Everything depends on this
   - Mitigation: Start immediately, allocate best developers
   - Have rollback plan ready

2. **Storage Layer** - Services depend on this
   - Mitigation: Can start design while Drizzle is in progress
   - Create interfaces early

### Low-Risk Parallel Work
- Error Factory and Interceptors have no dependencies
- Can be developed and tested independently
- Can be integrated last without blocking other work

## Success Criteria

Each improvement is complete when:
1. âœ… All code is migrated to new patterns
2. âœ… Tests are passing with new implementation
3. âœ… Documentation is updated
4. âœ… No regressions in functionality
5. âœ… Performance metrics meet or exceed targets

## Recommended Reading Order

For understanding the full picture:
1. Read this dependencies file first
2. Read 01-drizzle-orm-migration.md (foundation)
3. Read 09-implementation-roadmap.md (timeline)
4. Then read specific improvements based on your team assignment
