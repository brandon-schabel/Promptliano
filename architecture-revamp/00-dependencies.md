## Overview
This document maps the dependencies between all architecture improvements, identifying what must be done sequentially and what can be done in parallel.

## Critical Path (Sequential - MUST be in order)

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[01: Drizzle ORM Migration - Foundation] --> B[02: Storage Layer Overhaul]
    B --> C[03: Service Layer Patterns]
    A --> D[07: Frontend Hook Factory]
    D --> E[08: Frontend Optimizations]
```

## Parallel Work Opportunities

### After Drizzle ORM is complete, these can be done in parallel:

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Dependencies
1. **Drizzle ORM Migration** - Everything depends on this
   - Mitigation: Start immediately, allocate best developers
   - Have rollback plan ready

2. **Storage Layer** - Services depend on this
   - Mitigation: Can start design while Drizzle is in progress
   - Create interfaces early

### Low-Risk Parallel Work
- Error Factory and Interceptors have no dependencies
- Can be developed and tested independently
- Can be integrated last without blocking other work

## Success Criteria

Each improvement is complete when:
1. âœ… All code is migrated to new patterns
2. âœ… Tests are passing with new implementation
3. âœ… Documentation is updated
4. âœ… No regressions in functionality
5. âœ… Performance metrics meet or exceed targets
