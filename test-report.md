## Package Details

### ✅ @promptliano/shared

- **Status**: All tests passing
- **Tests**: 133 pass, 0 fail
- **Runtime**: 3.94s
- **Notes**: Clean test run with database migrations running successfully

### ✅ @promptliano/schemas

- **Status**: All tests passing
- **Tests**: 146 pass, 0 fail
- **Runtime**: 303ms
- **Notes**: Some validation warnings during global state tests but all tests pass

### ❌ @promptliano/services

- **Status**: Failing
- **Tests**: 317 pass, 12 fail, 38 skip
- **Runtime**: 4.32s
- **Key Failures**:
  - Queue system tests (consolidated queue operations)
  - Queue CRUD operations
  - Queue statistics calculations
  - Duplicate queue name constraints

**Common Error Pattern**:

```
ApiError: Queue with name "Test Queue [timestamp]" already exists in this project
```

### ❌ @promptliano/storage

- **Status**: Failing
- **Tests**: 69 pass, 34 fail, 3 skip
- **Runtime**: 2.69s
- **Key Failures**:
  - Database manager tests
  - Column-based storage migration issues
  - SQLite constraint errors
  - Missing `data` column in chat_messages table

**Common Error Pattern**:

```
SQLiteError: table chat_messages has no column named data
```

### ❌ @promptliano/api-client

- **Status**: Failing (Functional Tests)
- **Notes**: API functional tests failing due to:
  - Missing prompt resources (404 errors)
  - Database state issues
  - Test data not persisting between test runs

### ✅ @promptliano/config

- **Status**: All tests passing
- **Tests**: 5 pass, 0 fail
- **Runtime**: 126ms
- **Notes**: Small test suite, all passing

### ❌ @promptliano/server

- **Status**: Failing
- **Notes**: Test execution errors, likely related to missing dependencies or setup issues

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Database Schema Mismatches

- **Impact**: High
- **Packages Affected**: storage, services
- **Description**: Tables have been migrated from JSON to column-based storage but tests haven't been updated
- **Example**: `chat_messages` table expects column structure but tests use `data` field

### 2. Queue System Test Failures

- **Impact**: Medium
- **Packages Affected**: services
- **Description**: Queue tests failing due to duplicate name constraints and state management issues
- **Solution**: Tests need proper cleanup between runs

### 3. API Test Data Persistence

- **Impact**: Medium
- **Packages Affected**: api-client
- **Description**: Test data not properly created or cleaned up, causing 404 errors
- **Solution**: Ensure test fixtures are properly created before each test run

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Fix Database Schema Tests** - Update storage tests to use column-based schema instead of JSON `data` field
2. **Add Test Cleanup** - Implement proper cleanup in queue tests to avoid duplicate name errors
3. **Fix Test Fixtures** - Ensure API tests create necessary test data before running

### Medium Priority

1. **Review Skip Tests** - 41 tests are being skipped, review if they're still needed
2. **Improve Test Isolation** - Tests should not depend on previous test state
3. **Add Test Database Reset** - Ensure clean database state between test suites

### Long Term

1. **Add Integration Test Suite** - Separate unit tests from integration tests
2. **Implement Test Coverage Reporting** - Track coverage metrics
3. **Add CI/CD Test Automation** - Ensure tests run on every commit

## Test Execution Commands

To run all tests:

```bash
bun run test:all
```

To run individual package tests:

```bash
bun run test:shared    # ✅ Passing
bun run test:schemas   # ✅ Passing
bun run test:services  # ❌ Failing
bun run test:storage   # ❌ Failing
bun run test:api-client # ❌ Failing
bun run test:config    # ✅ Passing
bun run test:server    # ❌ Failing
```

## Migration Warnings

The following migrations are running during tests and show warnings:

- Migration 5: Tickets/Tasks table structure warnings
- Migration 6-12: Column-based storage conversions (DATA LOSS warnings)
- Migration 17: Unified Flow system migration
- Migration 23: Dropped queue_items table

These migrations indicate significant schema changes that may be affecting test stability.

## Conclusion

The test suite needs attention with **46+ failing tests** across critical packages (services, storage, api-client, server). The main issues stem from:

1. **Database schema evolution** - Tests not updated after migration from JSON to column-based storage
2. **Test isolation problems** - Tests affecting each other's state
3. **Missing test fixtures** - API tests expecting data that doesn't exist

Priority should be given to fixing the storage and services package tests as they form the foundation of the application.
