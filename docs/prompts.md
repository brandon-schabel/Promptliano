## 1. Understanding the Prompts Page

The Prompts Page serves as your personal command center for all AI instructions you want to save and reuse. Instead of typing the same detailed instructions repeatedly, you can create a prompt once and then easily apply it whenever needed.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Consistency:** Ensure the AI responds in a consistent tone, style, or format.
- **Efficiency:** Save time by quickly applying pre-written instructions.
- **Organization:** Keep your most effective AI directives organized and readily accessible.
- **Reusability:** Use the same prompt across multiple projects or for various tasks within a single project.

## 2. Accessing the Prompts Page

You can easily navigate to the Prompts Page from the main application menu.

1. Locate the main navigation bar (usually at the top or side of the application window).
2. Click on the **"Prompts"** link or icon.

## 3. Navigating the Prompts Page

The Prompts Page is designed for ease of use, allowing you to quickly find and manage your saved prompts.

`[SCREENSHOT: The main Prompts Page interface, highlighting the prompts list and search bar]`

### Prompts List

Upon entering the Prompts Page, you'll see a list of all your saved prompts. Each entry in the list typically displays:

- **Title:** The unique name you've given to the prompt.
- **Content Preview:** A snippet of the prompt's text to help you quickly identify it.

`[SCREENSHOT: A close-up of the prompts list, showing several example prompts with their titles and content previews]`

You can scroll through this list to browse your collection.

### Search Functionality

If you have a large library of prompts, the search functionality can help you find specific ones quickly.

1. Locate the **Search Bar** (usually positioned at the top of the prompts list).
2. Type keywords from the prompt's title or content into the search bar.
3. The list will dynamically filter to show only the prompts that match your search query.

   `[SCREENSHOT: A prompt in the list with its "Edit" button/icon highlighted]`
3. The prompt editing interface will open, pre-filled with the prompt's current title and content. This interface is typically the same as the one used for creating new prompts.
   `[SCREENSHOT: The "Edit Prompt" dialog/form, pre-filled with an example prompt's details]`
4. Make your desired changes to the title or content.
5. Click **"Save"** or **"Update"** to apply your changes.

### Deleting a Prompt

To remove a prompt you no longer need:

1. Find the prompt you want to delete in the Prompts List.
2. Click on the **"Delete"** button or icon (often a trash can symbol) next to the prompt entry.
   `[SCREENSHOT: A prompt in the list with its "Delete" button/icon highlighted]`
3. A confirmation dialog will appear to ensure you don't accidentally delete a prompt.
   `[SCREENSHOT: The "Confirm Delete" dialog box for a prompt]`
4. Click **"Delete"** or **"Confirm"** to permanently remove the prompt from your library. If you change your mind, click "Cancel".

**Note:** Deleting a prompt is usually permanent and cannot be undone.

## 5. Using Prompts in Your Projects

The true power of the Prompts Page comes from applying your saved prompts within your projects.

### Importing Prompts into a Project

Promptliano allows you to associate prompts from your global library with specific projects. This helps keep your project workspace clean and ensures you only see relevant prompts for the task at hand.

To use a library prompt in a project:

1. Navigate to the specific project you are working on (usually via the "Projects" page).
2. Within the project interface, look for the "Prompts" section (often part of a "Prompt Overview Panel" or similar).
   `[SCREENSHOT: The Project screen's "Prompt Overview Panel" highlighting where Project Prompts are listed or managed]`
3. You should find an option like **"Import Prompts," "Add Prompts from Library,"** or a similar button/menu.
   `[SCREENSHOT: The "Import Prompts" or "Add Prompts from Library" button/icon within a project's interface]`
4. Clicking this option will typically open a dialog or list displaying your global prompt library.
   `[SCREENSHOT: A dialog showing the global prompt library, allowing users to select prompts to import into the current project]`
5. Select the prompt(s) you want to use in the current project.
6. Confirm your selection. The chosen prompts will now be available for use within that project's context, appearing in the "Project Prompts" list for easy selection when interacting with the AI.

Importing prompts creates an association, meaning the original prompt remains in your global library, and you can use it in multiple projects.

### Benefits of Using Saved Prompts

- **Targeted Instructions:** Quickly apply complex or nuanced instructions tailored to specific coding tasks, refactoring efforts, or documentation generation.
- **Standardized Outputs:** Guide the AI to produce code, text, or analysis in a consistent style or format across your project.
- **Enhanced Collaboration (if applicable):** If working in a team, shared prompts can help maintain consistency in AI-assisted tasks.

## 6. Tips for Writing Effective Prompts

Crafting good prompts is key to getting the best results from AI. Here are a few general tips:

- **Be Clear and Specific:** The more precise your instructions, the better the AI can understand your intent.
- **Define the Persona (if needed):** Tell the AI to act as a specific role (e.g., "Act as a senior software engineer specializing in Python").
- **Provide Context:** Include relevant background information or snippets of code if the AI needs them.
- **Specify the Desired Format:** If you want output in a particular structure (e.g., JSON, a list, a specific code style), clearly state it.
- **Iterate and Refine:** Don't expect the perfect prompt on your first try. Experiment with different phrasings and levels of detail to see what works best. Save your most successful iterations in your Prompts Library!

By effectively utilizing the Prompts Page, you can significantly enhance your productivity and the quality of AI-generated outputs within Promptliano. Happy prompting!
