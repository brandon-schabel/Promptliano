## Summarizaction Actions
1. **Purpose & Context**  
   - In 1–2 bullets, describe what the code/file primarily does or represents.  

2. **Key Exports & Main Functions**  
   - List each exported or major function/class/constant by name.  
   - Summarize arguments, return type, and core logic in a single bullet per item.  
   - Briefly note possible usage scenarios.  

3. **Important Internal Logic or Data Flow**  
   - Mention critical internal steps, data transformations, or state management.  
   - Note any side effects (e.g. API calls, file I/O, database interactions).  

4. **Dependencies & Integration Details**  
   - List direct dependencies or significant external modules.  
   - If relevant, describe how the code integrates with or extends other parts of the system.  

**Goals & Guidelines:**  
- Use **concise bullet points**—omit minor details such as style or minor helper functions.  
- Emphasize **why** and **how** key exports are used.  
- Keep summaries **as short as possible**, but ensure enough clarity for an LLM to reason about usage and functionality.  
- Do **not** repeat information unnecessarily.
