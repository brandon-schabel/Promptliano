### Components NOT Migrated (Application-Specific)

These components are specific to the client application and should remain in the client package:

- ❌ **icons.tsx** - Application-specific icon definitions
- ❌ **resizable-panel.tsx** - Complex layout component
- ❌ **responsive-container.tsx** - Custom layout component
- ❌ **sortable-panel.tsx** - DnD functionality specific to the app
- ❌ **token-usage-tooltip.tsx** - Domain-specific component

- ❌ **vertical-resizable-panel.tsx** - Complex layout specific to the app
- ❌ **chart.tsx** - Can be migrated later if needed (requires recharts)

## Next Steps for Client Package

The client package should now:

1. **Update imports** to use `@promptliano/ui` instead of local components
2. **Remove duplicated components** that have been migrated
3. **Keep app-specific components** in the client package
4. **Update any custom styling** if needed

## Summary

The migration has successfully created a shared UI library with all commonly used shadcn/ui components. The @promptliano/ui package now provides:

- ✅ **Complete set of form components**
- ✅ **All essential data display components**
- ✅ **Full set of overlay and interaction components**
- ✅ **Basic data table implementation**
- ✅ **Toast notifications with Sonner**
- ✅ **Proper TypeScript support**
- ✅ **Tree-shakeable exports**
- ✅ **Consistent theming and styling**

The package has been built and tested successfully, ready for use across all Promptliano applications.
