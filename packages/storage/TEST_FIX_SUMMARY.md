# Test Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Database Lifecycle Management
- **Problem**: Database singleton was being closed in `afterEach` hooks, causing "database connection is closed" errors in subsequent tests
- **Solution**: 
  - Replaced `db.close()` with `db.clearAllTables()` in `afterEach` hooks
  - Added `DatabaseManager.reset()` only in `afterAll` hooks
  - Modified `ChatStorage` to always get fresh database instance instead of caching

### 2. Zod Validation Failures
- **Problem**: Chat objects in tests were missing required fields (title, created, updated)
- **Solution**: Ensured all test chat objects include required fields according to ChatSchema

### 3. Timestamp Synchronization
- **Problem**: `created_at` and `updated_at` database columns were not using the `created` and `updated` fields from data objects
- **Solution**: Modified `DatabaseManager.create()` and `update()` methods to extract timestamps from data objects when available

### 4. MCP Storage Test Failures
- **Problem**: MCP storage was using MemoryAdapter in test mode, but integration tests expected SQLite storage
- **Solution**: Updated MCP storage to use SQLiteDbManagerAdapter consistently for both test and production

### 5. Missing/Incorrect Test Files
- **Problem**: 
  - `prompt-service.test.ts` contained duplicate content from `project-service.test.ts`
  - No test file for `prompt-storage.ts`
- **Solution**: 
  - Created proper prompt service tests with full coverage
  - Created prompt storage tests to ensure SQLite integration works correctly

## Test Status

### ✅ Passing Tests
- `chat-storage.test.ts` - All 7 tests passing
- `database-manager.test.ts` - All 13 tests passing  
- `prompt-storage.test.ts` - All 6 tests passing (newly created)
- `prompt-service.test.ts` - All 17 tests passing (rewritten)

### ⚠️ Integration Tests
- `sqlite-integration.test.ts` - Most tests passing, some MCP-related tests may need additional fixes

## Key Changes Made

1. **Database Manager** (`database-manager.ts`):
   - Modified `create()` to use object's `created` timestamp for `created_at` column
   - Modified `update()` to use object's `updated` timestamp for `updated_at` column

2. **Chat Storage** (`chat-storage.ts`):
   - Removed cached database instance to avoid closed connection issues
   - Always gets fresh database instance via `getDb()`

3. **Test Files**:
   - Updated all test cleanup to use `clearAllTables()` instead of `close()`
   - Added proper `afterAll` hooks with `DatabaseManager.reset()`
   - Created comprehensive test coverage for prompt service and storage

## Recommendations

1. Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
2. Consider adding integration tests for all storage modules
3. Document the singleton pattern usage in DatabaseManager
4. Consider adding connection pooling for production use
